<div class="header">About Me</div>
<div id="about-me-text">Hi, I'm Leighton Jenkins. In 2021 I began a full-stack web development bootcamp program with Southern
  Methodist University. Though I am still a beginner, what I lack in professional experience I make up for
  in passion and determination. I am part-way through a Computer Engineering degree with the University of
  North Texas where I plan to graduate in 2023-24 and have big plans for the future. With this portfolio I
  hope to show you what I can bring to the proverbial table.</div>

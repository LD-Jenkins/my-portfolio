## Project Description

2/13/2021

This project is the beginning of an online portfolio to showcase the projects I have created myself either from scratch or starting from some code base.
The webpage features my name, a navigation bar for quick access to the documents sections, an area displaying images with links to my work and a contacts section where you may get ahold of me.

This starting design is intended to resemble that of an old terminal with green text and a black background. In the future as I complete more projects and gain more knowledge of the world of web development I intend to revisit the design of the webpage to bring out a more immersive look.

This project is 100% my original work aside from a background image I found at https://unsplash.com/ .

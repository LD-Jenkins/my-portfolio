## Project Description

Updated: 4/5/2021

This project is the beginning of an online portfolio to showcase the projects I have created myself either from scratch or starting from some code base.
The webpage features information about me, ways to contact me such as my LinkedIn and GitHub profile, a navigation bar that loads any content necessary without needing to load a new page, and an area displaying images and links to my work.

The design is intended to resemble that of an old CRT monitor showing the well-known lines of pixels. All images are set on an older Windows window that may be familiar to some. The simplicity of the site is an intentional design choice.

In the future I intend to dive deeper into the old Windows theme, adding more familiar old window styles, a scanline effect, and possibly a working, in-browser, slimmed down version of MS Paint.
